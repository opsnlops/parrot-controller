# Setup

This requires the following libraries:

```
https://github.com/Harbys/pico-ssd1306
https://github.com/jostlowe/Pico-DMX
```

On hotot it's in `~/code` and symlinked into the project.

# Power

From the docs:

> Whilst it is possible to connect the Raspberry Pi’s 5V pin to the Raspberry Pi Pico VBUS pin, this is not 
> recommended. Shorting the 5V rails together will mean that the Micro USB cannot be used. An exception is 
> when using the Raspberry Pi Pico in USB host mode, in this case 5V must be connected to the VBUS pin.
> The 3.3V pin is an OUTPUT pin on the Raspberry Pi Pico, you cannot power the Raspberry Pi Pico via this
> pin, and it should NOT be connected to a power source.

(ie, use VSYS 😅)
