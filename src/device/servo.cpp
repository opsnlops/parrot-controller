/**
 * @brief Initializes a servo and gets it ready for use
 *
 * The Servo that will be set up is the one that's passed in. Calling this function
 * will set up the PWM hardware to match the frequency that's provided. (Typically
 * 50Hz on a standard servo.)
 *
 * We work off pulse widths to servos, not percentages. The min and max pulse need
 * to be defined in microseconds. This will be mapped to the MIN_SERVO_POSITION and
 * MAX_SERVO_POSITION as defined in controller.h. (0-999 is typical.) The size of the
 * pulses need to be set to the particular servo and what it does inside of the
 * creature itself. (ie, don't bend a joint further than it should go!)
 *
 * The servo's PWM controller will be off by default to make sure it's not turned
 * on before we're ready to go.
 *
 * @param gpio The GPIO pin this servo is connected to
 * @param min_pulse_us Min pulse length in microseconds
 * @param max_pulse_us Max pulse length in microseconds
 * @param inverted are this servo's movements inverted?
 * @param frequency PWM frequency

 *
 * `servo_move()` does not actually move the servo. Instead, it marks it's requested
 * position in `desired_ticks` and waits for the IRQ handler to fire off to actually
 * move to that position. Working this way decouples changing the duty cycle from
 * the request to the PWM circuit, which is useful when moving servos following
 * some sort of external control. (DMX in our case!)
 *
 * The Pi Pico only adjusts the duty cycle when the counter rolls over. Doing it
 * more often wastes CPU cycles. (Calling `pwm_set_chan_level()` more than once a
 * frame is a waste of effort.)
 *
 * The IRQ handler follows the frequency of the first servo in the array declared in
 * main(). I would like to be able to support a bunch of different frequencies at once,
 * but as of right now, there's really not a need, and I'd rather not make the ISR
